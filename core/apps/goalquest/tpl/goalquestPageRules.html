            <h4>How it Works</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>ABC Corporation will assign each Sales Representative a base objective (the "Base Objective") for eligible sales during the program period (June 1 through August 31, 2010).</li>
                <li>Each Sales Representative will have the option to select one goal from among three different Goal Levels based on the Base Objective. Each Goal Level will have a different percent of sales objective attainment, and a different reward payout after attainment of the required level of sales.</li>
                <li>Goal Level must be chosen and entered on or before midnight on Friday May 28, 2010.</li>
                <li>No changes to individual goal selections can be made after May 28, 2010.</li>
                <li>At program end Sales Representatives who attain the required percentage achievement over objective, based on the previously selected Goal Level, will earn Points® rewards based on that Goal Level. If a Sales Representative does not achieve the required sales based on the selected Goal Level, that Agent will not receive any payout.</li>
                <li>If a Sales Representative achieves a higher level of sales than the Goal Level selected, awards will be paid only for the level selected, not the higher level achieved.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>ABC Corporation's GoalQuest® Goal Level Grid</h4>
            <p>The following grid represents the GoalQuest Goal Levels for Direct Sales Representatives in this program:</p>
            <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Level</td>
                        <td>Description</td>
                        <td>Award</td>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>1</td>
                        <td>103% of your adjusted Q3 sales results</td>
                        <td>250 Points</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>2</td>
                        <td>103% of your adjusted Q3 sales results</td>
                        <td>250 Points</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>3</td>
                        <td>103% of your adjusted Q3 sales results</td>
                        <td><a href="#">View Available Rewards</a></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <h4>How to Earn Awards—An Example</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If Sales Representative A selects Goal Level 1 from the grid above, he or she must achieve an adjusted Q3 2010 sales baseline plus 3% to qualify for any payout. If during the program period the Sales Representativeʼs total sales are at least 3% more than their adjusted Q3 2010 sales baseline the Sales Representative will be awarded 250 Points® at the conclusion of the program.</li>
                <li>If Sales Representative A selects Goal Level 2 from the grid above, he or she must achieve an adjusted Q3 2010 sales baseline plus 5% to qualify for any payout. If the Sales Representativeʼs total sales are at least 5% more than their adjusted Q3 2010 baseline the Sales Representative will be awarded 750 Points® at the conclusion of the program.</li>
