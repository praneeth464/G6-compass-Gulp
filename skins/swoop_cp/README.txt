The swoop_cp skin is a duplicate of swoop. Here's how each folder should be set up:

/css    (ignore. SASS will generate)
/img    (full duplicate of swoop/img with CP-specific images swapped in)
/js     (full duplicate of swoop/js with CP-specific changes made)
/scss   (duplicate of only the full files in the root of swoop/scss with imports directly to swoop's files)
